\chapter{The discovery of the Higgs boson and the role of the $H\rightarrow WW^{*}\rightarrow \ell\nu\ell\nu$ channel}

This chapter presents the results of the search for the Higgs boson in $4.8 \ifb$ collected at $\sqrt{s} = 7 \TeV$ and $5.8 \ifb$ at $\sqrt{s} = 8 \TeV$. The results of three searches at $\sqrt{s} = 8 \TeV$ in the $H\to \gamma \gamma$, $H\to ZZ \to 4\ell$, and \HWWfull channels are combined with results of searches at $\sqrt{s} = 7 \TeV$ in the same search channels (as well as the $H\to\tau\tau$ production and associated production searches for $H\to b\bar{b}$). The results of this combination are a $5.9 \sigma$ detection of a new particle consistent with a Higgs boson. Rather than going into detail for all of the different Higgs decay searches, this chapter will discuss the three most sensitive channels and in particular give a comparison of the $\gamma\gamma$ and $4\ell$ channels to the $\ell\nu\ell\nu$ channel.
