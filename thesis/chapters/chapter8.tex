\chapter{Combined limits from boosted and resolved searches}
\label{chap:4bcomb}

\section{Introduction}

In order to cover the full mass range of possible resonances decaying to di-Higgs final states, two distinct tailored selections were produced. The resolved selection is more sensitive in the mass range of $400 < m_{X} < 1100 \GeV$ while the boosted selection is more sensitive to masses in the range $1100 < m_{X} < 3000 \GeV$. Chapter 7 presents the details of the boosted selection and results. In setting limits on spin-2 Randall-Sundrum graviton (RSG) and narrow width heavy scalar ($H$) models, the results of the boosted selection are combined with the results of the resolved selection to cover the full mass range.

This chapter presents limits on signal models resulting from the $\FourBfull$ search in both the resolved and boosted selections. It first presents a brief overview of the resolved results that go into the limit setting. Then, limits on the RSG and heavy scaler models are presented.
