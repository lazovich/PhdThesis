\chapter{Search for Higgs pair production in boosted $\FourB$ final states}
\label{chap:hwwstrategy}

\section{Introduction}

After the discovery of the Higgs boson in the ATLAS Run 1 dataset and the subsequent measurements of its properties, the Higgs transformed into a potential tool in searches for physics beyond the Standard Model. The pair production cross section of the Higgs can be enhanced through BSM physics. Studying di-Higgs production also probes the Higgs self-coupling, shedding light on the structure of the Higgs potential. This chapter presents a search for resonant production of a Higgs pair in the $\FourBfull$ final state. In particular, this chapter focuses on a search for this final state in the regime where $m_{X}$ is large ($\gtrsim 1 \TeV$) and the Higgs bosons in the decay are significantly boosted. A tailored selection for this boosted selection, using novel techniques in jet substructure and $b$-tagging, is discussed. Then, the data-driven background estimate is presented. Finally, the results of the search are shown. Limits on signal models are reserved for the next chapter where the results of this chapter are combined with the results of a separate selection dedicated to the lower $m_X$ regime.
