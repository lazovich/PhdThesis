\indent This dissertation presents the observation and measurement of the Higgs boson in the \HWWfull channel at $\sqrt{s} = 7 \TeV$ and $\sqrt{s} = 8 \TeV$ and a search for Higgs pair production in the $HH\to b\bar{b}b\bar{b}$ channel at $\sqrt{s} = 13 \TeV$ with the ATLAS detector in $pp$ collisions at the Large Hadron Collider. 

First, the discovery of a particle consistent with the Higgs boson in $4.8\ifb$ at $\sqrt{s} = 7 \TeV$ and $5.8 \ifb$ at $\sqrt{s} = 8 \TeV$ is discussed. Then, the measurement of the Higgs boson signal strength and cross section in both the gluon fusion and vector boson fusion (VBF) production modes using $20.3\ifb$ of $\sqrt{s} = 8 \TeV$ data combined with $4.8\ifb$ of $7 \TeV$ data is shown. The combined signal strength is measured to be $\mu = 1.09^{+0.23}_{-0.21}$. The total observed significance of the $\HWW$ process is observed to be $6.1\sigma$ (with $5.8 \sigma$ expected). Advanced methods for background reduction and estimation, particularly in same-flavor lepton final states, are shown. The VBF signal strength is measured to be $\mu_{\rm VBF} = 1.27^{+0.53}_{-0.45}$ with an observed significance of $3.2\sigma$ (with $2.7 \sigma$ expected).  In the VBF channel, a selection requirement based method, the precursor to the final multivariate technique used for the result, is detailed. 

Finally, a search for Higgs pair production in the $b\bar{b}b\bar{b}$ final state with $3.2\ifb$ at $\sqrt{s} = 13\TeV$ is presented. A particular focus is placed on a tailored signal region for resonant production of Higgs pairs at high masses. No significant excesses are observed, and upper limits on cross sections are placed for spin-2 Randall Sundrum gravitons (RSG) and narrow spin-0 resonances. The cross section of $\sigma(pp \to \Gkk \to hh \to b\bar{b}b\bar{b})$ with $k/\bar{M}_{\rm Pl}=1$ is constrained to be less than $70 \fb$ for masses in the range $600 < m_{\Gkk} < 3000 \GeV$.  The cross section upper limits for $\sigma(pp \to H \to hh \to b\bar{b}b\bar{b})$ ranges from $30$ to $300 \fb$ in the mass range of $500 < m_{H} < 3000 \GeV$. 
%For the RSG model with $k/\bar{M}_{\rm Pl}=2$, cross sections limits between $40\fb$ and $200 \fb$ are set for the mass range of $500 < m_{\Gkk} < 3000 \GeV$.
